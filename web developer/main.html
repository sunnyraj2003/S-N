                <h2>Rajgir, meaning the abode of Gods, is a town in Nalanda district about 93 km southeast of Patna. It finds mention in the Mahabharata as the kingdom of Jarasandha, the arch nemesis of Krishna and his Yadava clan. While the exact date of Rajgir’s foundation is not known, the city is believed to be about 3000 years old. Rajgir is divided into two parts: one which is fortified and surrounded by seven hills and the other, which is believed to have been founded by King Bimbisara’s son, Ajatshatru. There are two local beliefs about the name of the town. One belief is that the town gets its name from the Hindi word  rajgriha which means royal house and the other states that the name comes from the rajgir (also a Hindi word), which means royal mountain.</h2>

        <h1>Bodh Gaya in Bihar is a pious pilgrimage site for different religions, but primarily for Buddhists. In fact, tourists from across the world visit this place of high prominence. This tourist spot got its name registered on the world map for being the land where Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment. Bodh Gaya marks its presence on the list of UNESCO world heritage sites for its magnificent Mahabodhi Temples and tourist destinations like Bodhi Tree, Thai Monastry and Great Buddha Statue that are worth stopping at. 

            November to February is the best time to visit Bodh Gaya as the weather is moderate during this time. One may explore the place to the fullest during this season because summer can be too hot, humid and harsh on you. </h1>

        <h1>Patna is the largest city of Bihar. Better known as Patliputra in ancient India, the city is also believed to be the one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Patna is a pilgrimage for Sikh devotees as it is reckoned to be the birthplace of last Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. The city flourished in the period of Haryanka, Nanda, Mauryan, Shunga, Gupta and Pala earned fame all across India. Today’s Patna is a developing city, which is endeavouring to match up to the modernization; malls, high-end hotels and theatres have cropped in the city. However, Patna has to speed up a bit to become the part of other cosmopolitans. Altogether, Patna is a decent destination, with most of the modern facilities available.</h1>

        <h1>Vaishali is an important archaeological site that was once the capital city of Licchavi rulers. Vaishali earned fame as a birthplace of last Jain Tirthankar Lord Mahavira. It is believed that Mahavira was born and brought up in 6th century BCE in Kundalagram of Republic of Vaishali. Another major event this place was a witness to was the last sermon of Buddha in 483 BCE. Vaishali was a prosperous kingdom during the time of Buddha, it is also known for its beautiful courtesan Amrapali. So, you see, one has enough to recall in Vaishali and adding to its historic charm is the well-preserved Ashokan Pillar. This ancient city finds mention in the travel accounts of eminent Chinese travellers like Fa-hien and Hieun Tsang.</h1>
